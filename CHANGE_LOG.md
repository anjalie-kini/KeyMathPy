(END OF OTHER PROJECT'S WEEK)

### February 18, 2018
* Fixed all compile errors in genetic algorithm code
* Got main test case working (geneticTest.py)

### February 19, 2018
* Added comments for Genetic Algorithm main code and test

### February 20, 2018
* Added comments for all functions
* Debugged and fixed all functions and tests in NumberTheory
* Debugged and fixed all functions and tests in Combinatorics
* Debugged and fixed all functions and tests in MiscGeo
* In each folder (Number Theory, Combinatorics, MiscGeo) merged all tests into a single class using unit test framework and Asserts

### February 22, 2018
* Enhanced GeneticAlgorithm by moving most variation (in terms of crossover policy or stop time conditions) out of test file into main file

### February 23, 2018
* Added two genetic algorithm testSuite

### February 24, 2018
* Fixed all tests so they work without being in the same folder as their corresponding functions

### February 25, 2018
* Debugged and fixed all functions of AnalyticGeo
* Merged all tests in AnalyticGeo into a single class using unit test framework and Asserts

### February 27, 2018
* Added point,line,plane classes and included implementations as methods of the classes
