# Contributing to KeyMathPy

Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to KeyMathPy. There is a lot to do. 
* If you are a developer, you could add or modify code.
* If you are well versed with math, you could review current function implementations and suggest new and useful functions.
* If you are not a developer or a perhaps you would like to help with the documentation. 

The process is straight-forward.

* For those just getting started with pull requests, GitHub has a
[howto](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
* Fork the KeyMathPy [git repository](https://github.com/keymathpy/keymathpy).
* Suggest a new function via email or IM and get it approved
* Write the code for the implementation of the new function
* Ensure tests work.
* Create a Pull Request against the [**dev**] branch of KeyMathPy.

Still interested? Then you should take a peek at the [developer documentation] to get more details.
