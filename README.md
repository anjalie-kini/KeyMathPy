# KeyMathPy

This repository contains a number of complex math functions implemented in python. They are divided into five fields: Combinatorics, Number Theory, Analytic Geometry, Miscellaneous Geometry, and Genetic Algorithm. 

The implementations are intended to be well-maintained, tested, and kept up to date. They should also be reasonably optimized for fast performance while still being easy to read. The tests can be used as templates for how to use/invoke the functions.

The header comments and the user docs each provide a different view of the functions.
